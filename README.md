## About me 


I am a systems analysis and development student and currently work at picpay as a product engineer. I have been studying Kubernetes to deepen my knowledge.

Between one command and another, I like to share knowledge, showing that difficult things are not impossible. I help people who are starting to study infrastructure, teaching IAC and Python in their spare time, seeking the rise of the periphery through technology.
